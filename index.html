      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm current a Research Librarian for Science & Engineering at the University of Virginia</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Boone, NC but have lived quite a few places.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to be outside. Mostly I like to rock climb and ski, but any outdoors activity is good. I also like to learn languages.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to combine my programming skills with my background in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Charlottesville, VA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been programming for a few years (mostly in python) and have learned a lot but feel I have gone as far as I can on my own. I enjoy programminng and feel like I have big holes in my knowledge, which led me to pursue a coding bootcamp. I think becoming a developer will be a good mix of my skills and a career path that will keep me engaged for years to come.</p>
